This was one of my favorite projects at RBoot. I created the materialize front end with the animations. It was fun styling all the pages, and pulling together our AJAX calls from youtube and GIPHY.

You can search content on the serach bar and resluts appear on the cubes. It makes calls to GIPHY, Youtube, and wikipedia APIs.



Fun Stuff.

Enjoy!
